# Product-Review-Analysis-using-BERT-and-Tensorflow

# Project Description

This project demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is a powerful pre-trained language model that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, such as text classification. In this project, we will use TensorFlow and Hugging Face's Transformers library to fine-tune a BERT model for text classification.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install transformers
pip install tensorflow-datasets
```

## Dataset

We will use a dataset named "test req og.csv." This dataset will be split into training and testing sets for text classification. The data is required to be cleaned and preprocessed to fit the BERT model's input requirements.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing involves tokenizing the text using BERT's tokenizer and converting the text into features compatible with the BERT model. This includes encoding the text, adding special tokens, setting the maximum length, and creating attention masks.

## Model Fine-Tuning

We'll fine-tune the BERT model for text classification. The BERT model we use is "bert-base-uncased." The model will be fine-tuned to predict the appropriate class labels for the text data.

## Training

Training parameters, such as the learning rate, number of epochs, and optimizer, will be configured. We will compile and train the BERT model on the training dataset and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.

## Results

We will analyze the results, including loss and accuracy, and assess how well the BERT model performs on the text classification task.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project showcases the fine-tuning of a BERT model for text classification. The BERT model's powerful natural language understanding capabilities make it a suitable choice for various NLP tasks.
